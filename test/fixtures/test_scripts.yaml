# The run configuration defines how the `sequences` are executed in parallel
# sessions.
config:
  name: Test WebDAV
  details: |
    This scenario runs some tests against a WebDAV server.
    We use it to test stressor against a locally running WsgiDAV server:
    - Open a terminal and run
      $ wsgidav --root test/fixtures/ --port 8082 --auth anonymous
    - Open a second terminal and run
      $ stressor run test/fixtures/test_mock_server
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8082

context:

sessions:
  users: $load(users.yaml)
  count: 3

# Define what actions should be performed by every session
scenario:
  - sequence: init
  - sequence: main
    # repeat: 3
