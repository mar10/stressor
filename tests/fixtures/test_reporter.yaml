    This scenario runs some tests against a WebDAV server.
    We use it to test stressor against a locally running WsgiDAV server:
    - Open a terminal and run
      $ wsgidav --root tests/fixtures/ --port 8082 --auth anonymous
    - Open a second terminal and run
      $ stressor run tests/fixtures/test_mock_server
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8082
